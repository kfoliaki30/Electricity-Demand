New Information
One initiative and research that Emily (CSAFE) is working on is very interesting (i need to follow her research)
As temperature rise, the demand for cooling increase and it is same when temperature decrease, the demand for heating increase. 
One of the idea that is interesting is using the temperature forecast (meteorology) to study the temperature for every year
This can be use to predict a specific time in the year that temperature will rise and government or power utility can use specific demand management initiative to tackle demand peak problems
I need to use this as well in my Ph.D research
